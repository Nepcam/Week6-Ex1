# Week6-Ex1
Practical Handin

Lotto is looking at developing a new mobile app, and they have asked you to help develop the prototype. You are to build a
program to draw a grid of lotto balls on a smart-phone display.The program will ask the user to type in the number of lotto balls
in a row. The program will have a Draw Phone button that will draw the phone. The program will also have a Draw Balls
button that will draw a grid of lotto balls on the phone display. The grid will have the user specified number of lotto balls in a
row, and as many rows (and gaps) as will fit in the display height.
We will use a coloured ellipse to represent a lotto ball.
